NAME
    Test::Pod::LinkCheck - Tests POD for invalid links

VERSION
      This document describes v0.004 of Test::Pod::LinkCheck - released May 27, 2010 as part of Test-Pod-LinkCheck.

SYNOPSIS
            #!/usr/bin/perl
            use strict; use warnings;

            use Test::More;

            eval "use Test::Pod::LinkCheck";
            if ( $@ ) {
                    plan skip_all => 'Test::Pod::LinkCheck required for testing POD';
            } else {
                    Test::Pod::LinkCheck->new->all_pod_ok;
            }

DESCRIPTION
    This module looks for any links in your POD and verifies that they point
    to a valid resource. It uses the Pod::Simple parser to analyze the pod
    files and look at their links. In a nutshell, it looks for "L<Foo>"
    links and makes sure that Foo exists. It also recognizes section links,
    "L</SYNOPSIS>" for example. Also, manpages are resolved and checked. If
    you linked to a CPAN module and it is not installed, it is an error!

    This module does NOT check "http" links like "L<http://www.google.com>"
    in your pod. For that, please check out Test::Pod::No404s.

    Normally, you wouldn't want this test to be run during end-user
    installation because they might not have the modules installed! It is
    HIGHLY recommended that this be used only for module authors'
    RELEASE_TESTING phase. To do that, just modify the synopsis to add an
    env check :)

    This module normally uses the OO method to run tests, but you can use
    the functional style too. Just explicitly ask for the "all_pod_ok" or
    "pod_ok" function to be imported when you use this module.

            #!/usr/bin/perl
            use strict; use warnings;
            use Test::Pod::LinkCheck qw( all_pod_ok );
            all_pod_ok();

ATTRIBUTES
  check_cpan
    If disabled, this module will not check the CPAN module database to see
    if a link is a valid CPAN module or not. As of now this module only
    supports CPANPLUS as the backend, others may be added.

    The default is: true

  cpan_backend
    Selects the CPAN backend to use for querying modules. The available ones
    are: CPANPLUS, CPAN, and CPANSQLite.

    The default is: CPANPLUS

  cpan_section_err
    If enabled, a link pointing to a CPAN module's specific section is
    treated as an error. Since the module isn't installed we are unable to
    verify the section actually exists.

    The default is: false

  verbose
    If enabled, this module will print extra diagnostics for the links it's
    checking.

    The default is: true

METHODS
  pod_ok
    Accepts the filename to check, and an optional test name.

    This method will pass the test if there is no POD links present in the
    POD or if all links are not an error. Furthermore, if the POD was
    malformed as reported by Pod::Simple, the test will fail and not attempt
    to check the links.

    When it fails, this will show any failing links as diagnostics. Also,
    some extra information is printed if verbose is enabled.

    The default test name is: "LinkCheck test for FILENAME"

  all_pod_ok
    Accepts an optional array of files to check. By default it uses all POD
    files in your distribution.

    This method is what you will usually run. Every file is passed to the
    "pod_ok" function. This also sets the test plan to be the number of
    files.
